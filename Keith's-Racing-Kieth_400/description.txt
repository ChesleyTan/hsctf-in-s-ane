Keith is traveling on space trains, this time with his little brother 
Kieth and in a system of planets to reach the planet WWP9001. In this case, space trains are trains that service two planets and can go back and forth between them. Since multiple train routes can reach WWP9001 in the same time, as a tiebreaker, the two have assigned each train a point value (between -500 and 500, inclusive). The number of points that each of them gains is the sum of the point values assigned to each train they take to reach WWP9001, and if both arrive at the same time, whoever has fewer points wins. Keith wants to win very badly, and so given E lines (1 <= E <= 25000), each of which describes a train by its starting planet, ending planet, travel time, and point value, he wants your help to find not only the shortest time he needs to reach WWP9001, but also the fewest number of points he can get if he travels along some route which takes this shortest time. The set of planets that are serviced by space trains are numbered from 0 to V-1 (1 <= V <= 1500), inclusive, and Keith starts on planet 0 (also known as Earth) and wants to arrive at planet V-1 (planet WWP151337).

The flag format of this problem is the following: shorest_path number_of_points (there is a single space in between the two numbers).
