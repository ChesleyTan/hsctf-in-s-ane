Keith the Track Star

Keith is on High School Northsouth's track team. He is currently practicing hurdles, which are arranged in K lanes on the track. Keith is very fast at running,
but there is just one problem: he can't jump hurdles. But Keith is undeterred by this problem; he can switch lanes to get out of the way of an oncoming hurdle, although
he must slow down to do so. Of course he wants to finish in the fastest possible time, so he wants to minimize the number of times he switches lanes.

The track itself can be represented by an N x K grid (N = 10^4, K = 10^2), some cells of which are occupied by hurdles and so Keith cannot occupy such cells. He starts at some lane on row 0
of this grid and will end in some lane on row N - 1. When he is in row i and lane j, he can only move to row i+1, but he can move to lanes j-1, j, or j+1, if they exist.
(Only lanes 0-(K-1) exist; lane -1 and lane K do not exist). Moving from row i to row i+1 but staying in lane j will take (essentially) 0 seconds, while moving to lane j-1 or
lane j+1 will take 1 second. Given N and the locations of the hurdles in the grid, find the minimum time Keith will need (or the minimum number of lane switches Keith 
needs to make) to start at row 0 and end on row N. High School Northsouth's track is very long and so assume that the track does not loop around on itself
like a standard track as in the Olympics. So that there's always a place he can start or end, assume there are no hurdles in rows 0 and N - 1;

The input format is as follows:
The first line consists of three integers: N, K, and the number of hurdles, H.
There are H lines after that. Each line corresponds to a hurdle. The first number is the row, and the second number is the lane for that hurdle.
The output is the smallest amount of time Keith needs to take to get from some lane in row 0 to some lane in row N - 1.
