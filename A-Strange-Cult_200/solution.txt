After a lot of googling, I got to a page documenting The Holy Log.

In one of the lines, it states:
For every hole in the log caused by your replacement you shall plant ten saplings.

The problem description is:
Keith has discovered a strange cult based around a log of all things! He needs you to answer this question based on its teachings:
If I create 13 holes in a log by replacing with it, what must I plant?

So if we create 13 holes, we must plant 13*10 saplings.

That's the flag: 130 saplings
