This sort of requires us to do the other web problems that deal with Keith, in this case, Lulzsec VS. Keith

Lulzsec VS. Keith is hosted at http://104.236.80.67/LulzsecVSKeith/login.php

So, why don't we try login.php for Keith Mix??

http://104.236.80.67/KeithMix/login.php

Looking at the source, we get at the bottom a hash: 
<!-- Nice! Here is is: 804c8d2c39f2fedd9fce1586ebb995e86b66b52c -->

Using md5hashing.net:
http://md5hashing.net/search/all/804c8d2c39f2fedd9fce1586ebb995e86b66b52c?is_search=true#main

We get the unhashed value as 'swag'

Inputting that as the password, we get:

Enjoy the flag.......
