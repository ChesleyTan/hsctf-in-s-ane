Keith built an enclosure for his longtime companion, Daisy the Round and Fluffy Sheep.  The enclosure is a polygon that is not self-intersecting, but is not necessarily convex.  

Daisy daydreams about rubber bands.  Really, really, big rubber bands.  One day, she wonders: if a very long rubber band is pulled around her enclosure and allowed to snap taut, what will be the area enclosed between the enclosure's fence and the rubber band? 

Input format:
A sequence of at most 1000 pairs of integers X,Y (-40,000<=X,Y<=40,000) representing the vertices of Daisy's enclosure, in order in the xy plane.

The flag is the area between the fence and rubber band for the input file provided. The flag is guaranteed to be a 32-bit integer. 

Example 1 input:
0 0
1 0

Example 1 flag: 0

Example 2 input:
0 0
1 -1
