Using the built in polyarea and convexhull function this is easy

First split the file into 2 seperater files containing xValues and yValues respectivly. (Easy to do in any language)

Then in octave

xVals = load("sheepXInput.txt");
yVals = load("sheepYInput.txt");
insideArea = polyarea(xVals, yVals);
vi = convhull(xVals, yVals);
outerArea = polyarea(xVals(vi), yVals(vi));
outerArea - insideArea
