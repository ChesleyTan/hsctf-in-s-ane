Using the python script, I was able to count the frequency of the appearances of
words. Even when using Markov Chains, and with a data set of such a large size,
there should've been at least 100 of each word. However, in the count, I noticed
that there was only a single instance of 'Solution', 'logic"', and 'spaces.'

> python frequency.py
'logic"': 1, 'spaces.': 1, 'Solution': 1

So, let's grep the file for this:

> cat markovhaystack.txt | grep "Solution"
    Solution of this problem is "computer science logic" with no spaces.
