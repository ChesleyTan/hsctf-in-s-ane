As usual, we go to http://www.javadecompilers.com to decompile this thing (even
though the problem name is JD-GUI), then we can see that this is a
bi-directional substitution cipher. It checks if the encryption of the entry is
equal to the string "ichvjnvtsaftpgfkoevk". We simply enter that string into the
encryption to get what would encrypt to it, which is "jdguimustbesohelpful"
which is the flag.
