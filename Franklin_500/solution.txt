We first disassembled the code using IDA Pro to get some pseudo C code.

Then, we did a bit of annotation on the code until we realized that
the code was just asking for 16 numbers to represent a 4x4 square. It
checks whether each row, column, and diagonal (even diagonals that wrap
around the square grid) are equal to the same number.

This reminded me of problems that I did back in 3rd grade where we got
a 3x3 grid that had to have every row, column, and diagonal add up to 15.
So, let's search it up:

On the wikipedia page, we were lucky to get a already solved 4x4 grid.

7   12  1   14
2   13  8   11
16  3   10  5
9   6   15  4

> nc 104.236.80.67 5689
    7;12;1;14;2;13;8;11;16;3;10;5;9;6;15;4
    Yay, you got it!
