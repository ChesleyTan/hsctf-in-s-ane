Keith designs windows in his free time. His windows are rectangles with dimensions M cm x N cm, where M and N are positive integers. Having been a window
aficionado for years, he believes that the best windows are those whose diagonals are also an integer number of centimeters or those that are square. He
wants to design a window that will be most pleasing to him based on these criteria, but he knows that both conditions cannot be satisfied simultaneously.
He is willing to make windows whose dimensions are close to square but not exactly square, namely those with dimensions M cm x (M+1) cm, since from afar,
these look square.

One day, Keith has a client who is willing to have windows with larger dimension strictly under a given value A (1 <= A <= 10^10) (The client may have a
very large house). He wonders what kind of windows that he can make that satisfy his conditions for a pleasing window as well as the client's condition.
Please help him compute the sum of the smaller dimensions of all the windows that satisfy all of these conditions.

Input:

Line 1: An integer A that represents the maximum value that the larger dimension of a pleasing window can be. Note that a pleasing window cannot have larger dimension equal
to A.

Output:

One line that consists of an integer representing the sum of the smaller dimensions of all the windows that satisfy all of the conditions.

Example input:
10

Example output:
3

Explanation:
A window that is 3 cm x 4 cm satisfies the conditions, and it is fairly easy to check that this is the only solution with the larger dimension under 10.
